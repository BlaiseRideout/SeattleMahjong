# Links to Mahjong Resources

You can find many places online that sell mahjong sets.
We have frequently used [Yellow Mountain Imports](https://ymimports.com) for our equipment.

The [World Riichi Championship web site](https://worldriichi.org/) has
resources for their regular competitions.  They publish an [official
rule set](https://worldriichi.org/wrc-rules/) that the Seattle Riichi
Mahjong Club largely follows.

The [North American Riichi Mahjong Association (NARMA)
https://www.nariichi.org/](https://www.nariichi.org/) organizes clubs
and tournaments across North America.  You can find other clubs near
you on their site.
