# Counting Fu - Points in the Hand

This is a guide to counting the points in a winning mahjong hand.
These points are called "fu".  They are different from the winning condition
or "yaku" which applies to the overall pattern of the tiles in the hand.
The "yaku" determine the "han" value of the hand.  See [our guide to basic
yaku](/guides/yaku) for a description of han values.

To count the fu points in a hand, go through the following sequence.

1. A winning hand (other than Chitoitsu) is scored with 20 starting **fu.**
2. Ten **fu** are added if the hand is **closed** and the winning tile comes from a discard (not drawn from the wall).
3. Add **fu** of the triplets, quads, and the pair (see chart below).
   Sequences are not worth any **fu**.
4. Add **fu** according to the wait (see chart below).
5. Add **2 fu** if one wins by self-draw.
6. Round up to the nearest multiple of 10.
7. Winning with Chitoitsu is an automatic 25 **fu** with no rounding up.

## Total Score

Once you know the han and fu values of a hand, plus whether the dealer
won and whether it was won by drawing from the wall (tsumo) or not,
you can determine the hand's value from a chart or use [our handy online 
calculator](https://seattlemahjong.club/pointcalculator).  There can also
be scores from honba (when the dealer remains dealer for multiple hands)
and unclaimed riichi bets.
