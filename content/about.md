The Seatle Riichi Mahjong Club is a group of people interested in learning and playing the ancient game of mahjong.  We meet weekly throughout the year to play games at locations around the Seattle Washington metropolitan area.  We keep track of our game scores and maintain a [Leaderboard and player statistics](https://seattlemahjong.club).

We play a Japanese style of the game called _riichi mahjong_.  See our [Beginner's Guide](/beginners) to read a description and get started.

We use Meetup.com to help attract new members and get RSVPs for people attending <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Mahjong-Group/" target="_blank">our Weekly Meetup</a> and other events.

We use our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SeattleMahjong/" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SeattleMahjong" target="_blank">Twitter Site</a> for getting information out, as well.
