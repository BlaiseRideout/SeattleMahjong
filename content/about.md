Hello! The Seatle Riichi Mahjong Club is a group of people interested in
learning and playing the ancient game of mahjong.  We meet weekly
throughout the year to play games at locations around the Seattle
Washington metropolitan area.  We keep track of our game scores and
maintain a [Leaderboard and player
statistics](https://seattlemahjong.club) for our club games.  We also
host tournaments and introduction to mahjong events which are
described in more detail in our [Blog](/categories/blog).

We play a Japanese style of the game called _riichi mahjong_.  See our
[Beginner's Guide](/guides/beginners) to read a description and get
started.

We use Meetup.com to help attract new members and get RSVPs for people attending <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Mahjong-Group/" target="_blank">our Weekly Meetup</a> and other events.

We use our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SeattleMahjong/" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SeattleMahjong" target="_blank">Twitter Site</a> for getting information out, as well.
