The Seattle Riichi Mahjong Club held the [2018 Seattle Riichi Open tournament](https://seattleriichi.wordpress.com/2018-seattle-riichi-open/) at [Granite Curling Club](http://curlingseattle.org) on July 21st and 22nd.

Twenty-four players from across the United States and Canada competed
for the title.  It was a fun event with some very exciting action,
including some nearly complete yakuman hands, a chombo that prevented
one player from making the semi-finals, and close finish.  The
[final scores](https://tomas.seattlemahjong.club/t/2018%20Seattle%20Riichi%20Open/tournament)
are available on the [our tournament website,
tomas.seattlemahjong.club](https://tomas.seattlemahjong.club).  Rachel
Halperin of the Pacific Mahjong Leage was the final champion after
fending off a tough challenge from Michael Mcleod of the Nine Gates
Mahjong Club in the final round.  Rachel had built up a big lead in
the 6 preliminary rounds.  Michael was able to close the gap to 3.3
points and could have won, if another player had paid out the last
hand.

Shane Zamora provided all the equipment and software to make live streaming of table 1 possible.  The videos of the event are on [the club's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzpeG7FZ0Ao).
