# 2018 Seattle Riichi Open

Hello everyone! Another Seattle Riichi Open has concluded and we have
a new champion! Of course, last year’s champion, Charles McDonnell was
not able to attend, so of course it had to be a new one, but details…

## Attendance

We had a group of 24 people participating with members from University
of British Columbia, the Pacific Mahjong League, LA Pride of Mahjong,
and even from the Nine Gates/USPML from New York! All in all it was a
great turnout.

There were some issues with the software during the tournament
that prevented showing how the semi-final and final rounds went,
but those are fixed now.

## Round Robin Phase

The results after Day 1 seemed to indicate a very close spread, with
the exception of Canada’s Lillian Hoenig who had put in a strong first
place finish in Round 4 putting her over 10 points clear of 2nd place.

Instead, a triumvirate was able to get through the ruckus and join
Lillian atop the peak led by PML’s Rachel Halperin who secured 2 first
place finishes and jumped to the lead, 16 points clear of
Lillian. Seattle’s Blaise Ritchie and Nine Gates’ alumnus Michael
McLeod got a first for themselves, trailing Lillian by about the same
margin.

## Semi-Finals

For the final 4 spots, it was pretty much a bloodbath. Setbacks from
Seattle’s Shane Rideout and William Gosewehr opened the door for
others. LAPOM’s 2 representatives, Ruriko Duer and Terry Jane Kurobe
both put in solid 2nd place finishes and methodically moved into 5th
and 6th. Same went for Seattle’s Patrick Nguyen, who even after losing
1st place in the 5th round, put in 2 seconds and ended in 7th. The
person he lost 1st to in that round, PML’s Daniel Moreno, did just
enough in the 6th round to sneak into the playoffs.

Now unfortunately, I had changed the format of the tournament to have
no adjustment of scores between qualifying and playoffs (more on that
in the Tournament Director’s post-mortem). This meant that going into
the semifinals, there would need to be a major stumble by some of the
top 4 or a huge score posted by someone in the 5 to 8 slot in order
to change who played in the top 4 final table.

On Table 2, such a result was posted. In fact, Michael McLeod had run
away at the table, posting a score for 32.7 moving him to a net score
of 96.3. This came at the expense of Lillian Hoenig who, with her -26
score, suddenly found herself with a total of 47.4. And while neither
Ruriko or Patrick could take advantage, the focus shifted onto the
feature table.

Things were looking pretty grim as Rachel continued her hot streak,
jumping to over 40000 points early in the final round and making the
task of catching up near impossible. However Blaise, who had been
sitting in 3rd, was in danger of finishing last – a danger that became
critical when Rachel hit him for a mangan hand, bringing his point
total to 16500. If that score and placing held, that -28.5 score would
have brought him down to 36.8, putting him in distance not only from
Terry Jane (3.4 behind), but Daniel as well (17.2 behind). Daniel
would need a haneman hand, while Terry Jane would need to just
overtake Daniel to pass Blaise overall.

The first hand of the S4 semi-final was nuts. Rachel was isshanten for
kokushi musou (13 orphans) needing both the chun (red dragon) and the
hatsu (green dragon). Daniel riichi'ed on a chiitoitsu (7 pairs)
hand. Any uradora would make it a mangan, so he would either need to
tsumo or have Blaise deal in to garner sufficient points. That was
made relevant when Terry Jane closed kanned the 5 man, revealing 2 pin
as the new dora, automatically giving Daniel the mangan hand he
needed. Meanwhile, Terry Jane was tenpai waiting on the original dora,
which hadn’t come out.

The hand would go to ryuukoku (draw), and Blaise and Terry Jane both
were tenpai. That meant that Terry Jane was in 2nd and as long as
Blaise did not win a hand, she would be in 4th overall.

Starting the next hand of S4, Daniel’s hand seemed far away from
mangan status, Rachel’s certainly wasn’t yakuman caliber but wasn’t
terrible either. Terry Jane’s had all the trappings of a big hand,
while Blaise’s hand was close to tenpai.
Terry Jane pushed calling pon on the North, then subsequently on the
South. Rachel too had called twice into tenpai, looking to put an end
to the game.

Instead, Blaise declares riichi, ippatsu tsumos (wins on his very next
draw), and when he flips over the uradora, gets one more han for a
mangan, effectively ending both Daniel and Terry Jane’s chances.

That left the standings after the semifinals as:

 1. Rachel Halperin +121.6
 2. Michael McLeod +96.3
 3. Blaise Ritchie +71.1
 4. Lillian Hoenig +47.4
 5. Patrick Nguyen +31
 6. Ruriko Duer +23.8
 7. Terry Jane Kurobe +21
 8. Daniel Moreno +4.6

## Finals

On to the finals we went, with Michael within striking distance,
Blaise needed some help and Lillian needing a lot of help. But then
disaster for everyone looking for an upset as Rachel hit Lillian for a
mangan hand jumping out to a big lead.

Michael responded in kind with a riichi-ippatsu-tsumo-dora for a
mangan of his own and it was game on between the two for first
overall.

By the time all last came about, Michael led Rachel by 4000
points. That meant that he would claw back 14 points of is 25 point
deficit leaving him behind by 11.3. A mangan direct hit off of Rachel
or a haneman hand would be enough to overtake. He’d start the hand
with 2 dora in hand and then having called twice, draws the third!
Tanyao-dora 3 makes for an instant mangan!

But instead, he takes the win off of Lillian, meaning that by a margin
of 3.3 points, Rachel Halperin wins the 2018 Seattle Riichi Open!
Here are the final scores:

 1. Rachel Halperin +137.4
 1. Michael McLeod +134.1
 1. Blaise Ritchie +52.3
 1. Lillian Hoenig +12.6
 1. Patrick Nguyen +57.3
 1. Terry Jane Kurobe +22.8

 1. John Erickson +73.2
 1. Shane Rideout -2.9
 1. William Gosewehr -9.9

 1. Zachary Francks W/D


## Tournament Director Post-Mortem

As with the tournament last year I am providing a post-mortem about
the tournament format.

The biggest glaring issue is the actions post cut. In looking at the
2017 results, there was just a 13 point gap between 1st and 7th. I
perhaps thought it was because of the tournament format, so a division
of scores was not necessary. However, this tournament shows that no
format is immune to such a result, almost making the playoff rounds
inconsequential.

So what to do then? Does the format then fail?

Perhaps the best answer is, it depends. First, the field was smaller
this year than last (24 vs 36), making the pool of players smaller and
possibly concentrating the differences in skill levels. In addition,
the gaps became worse when the Top 16 were paired against each other,
not better like in 2017.

In fact, it would have been fine if with 24 players we had a 4 person
playoff instead.

So perhaps the first adjustment to be made is that with 24 players,
playoffs include the top 4 only.

In addition the quartile pairing system used in the first 4 rounds
somehow prevented people from pulling away outside of Lillian in the
4th round.

Maybe then, the correct thing to do is to play 9 rounds in all. 5
rounds of qualifying, then a double hanchan for the semifinals and
finals.

In the end, I don’t think the pairing system failed, instead it just
needs to be adapted better to the situation.

The other thing is with respect to wind assignments. I think until we
find a way to automate the process to balance winds and reverse any
seating position when players play each other a second time, it may be
a variable that is too much to take into account at this stage while
trying to keep a schedule.
